            1: `You are now high school students. Some of you feel excited, and others feel nervous. “How many friends can I make?” “Can I find a true friend?” You enter the classroom and talk to some classmates. If you like each other, you can exchange social media information later. In the past, friendships grew slowly, but now it is quite different. If you become friends online, you can get in touch anytime. Moreover, social media gives you so much information about your friends—their hobbies, favorites, experiences, and so on. Thanks to social media, you can become close more quickly than ever before. This is one feature of friendships in the digital age.`,
            2: `You have a lot of opportunities to make friends. This is another feature of friendships in the Internet age. Through social media, you can easily connect with anyone in the world. For instance, you can share your dreams and interests with more people online. Sometimes you cannot find friends with the same hobby as yours at school. However, in the online world, you can find people with similar interests. Additionally, you can share your worries or problems with online friends. Some of you don’t want to talk about your private or sensitive problems with school friends. However, if you communicate online, your “friends” may give you good advice.`,
            3: `The world of social media has not only positive points but also negative ones. In fact, online friendships are more delicate than face-to-face friendships. For example, “friends” sometimes attack each other without thinking. They may overreact and block a person from their online group. Additionally, they may expose someone’s personal information by accident or even on purpose. Online communication sometimes makes people unhappy or sad. Therefore, you have to be very careful in the online world. Social media is quite useful if you can avoid these negative points. You can make more friends and become close more quickly. Today, there are many ways to connect with other people. How will you make friends in the digital age?`

            1: `International Expositions, or Expos, are large public fairs to introduce ideas for our future. Each country exhibits unique products and new technologies. The first Expo was held over 170 years ago, in London in 1851. In 1867, Japan took part in its first Expo at the Paris Exposition. Visitors were fascinated by Japanese displays. They especially enjoyed ukiyoe, kimono, and a Japanese-style house. For Westerners, Asian-style life was new and interesting. After that, Japonism came into fashion around Europe. About a hundred years later, in 1970, Expo ’70 was held in Osaka. It was the first Expo in Asia. The event lasted for six months and turned out to be a great success. By the closing date, over 64 million people in total had visited it from all over the world.`,
            2: `Since the first Expo in London, Expos have showcased human progress. We can get several benefits from Expos. Take Expo ’70 in Osaka, for example. First, we can introduce new technologies to the public. People were surprised at the wireless telephone, and called it the “dream phone.” This led to the birth of the mobile phone. Second, the host country can make economic developments. Expo visitors activated the local economy in many ways. Additionally, expressways, subways, and a monorail were built for the event. Third, some new products can become popular through Expos. One year before Expo ’70, the world’s first canned coffee went on sale in Japan. It did not attract people’s attention at first. However, it became very popular after it was introduced at the Expo.`,
            3: `As we have seen, Expos provide many wonderful opportunities. However, the focus of Expos has been changing these days. Today, the world is facing many problems: poverty, wars, environmental issues, and so on. To deal with these problems, the United Nations set the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015. With these goals, it hopes to make the world better by 2030 through global cooperation. Expos can be opportunities to make changes. We can solve social problems together with knowledge from around the world. Expos offer great opportunities for collaboration among countries. Therefore, they can play a role in realizing our global goals. What kind of future will you design at the next Expo?`

            1: `“I want to be Japanese,” said the American woman at the start of the interview. Her stage name is Kyokudo Nanshun, and she is a professional kodan-shi. Kodan is a traditional style of Japanese storytelling. Kodan-shi recite Japanese historical episodes with dramatic, rhythmic chanting. They also tap a low desk with a leather-bound fan to show emphasis in the story. At university in the US, Nanshun studied Japanese hard. After she graduated, she came to Japan as an English teacher. She enjoyed kimono, iaido, and traditional performing arts such as bunraku, noh, and rakugo. One day, she attended a kodan performance for the first time, and was moved quite deeply. At that time, she thought, “This is it! I want to become a kodan-shi.” In 2013, she was given the name Kyokudo Nanshun by her master Kyokudo Nanryo IV.`,
            2: `Nanshun discusses kodan in the interview. Interviewer: Why are you so attracted to kodan? Nanshun: There are several reasons. First, I admire the beautiful hand movements in kodan. The first time I saw a performance, the storyteller used very graceful gestures to express a blooming flower. Next, I love the expressions on the faces of kodan-shi. They can skillfully show the confidence of a samurai or the evilness of a demon. The audience can clearly imagine the kodan stories because all the characters are described so vividly. For me, kodan is a deeply creative world. Interviewer: Wow! You are really attracted to the creativity of kodan. Nanshun: Yes, but I love the kodan stories themselves as well. There are a great number of interesting characters in Japanese history. They all can be expressed so realistically by kodan-shi. I’m a big fan of Sakamoto Ryoma and I really enjoy telling stories about his dramatic life.`,
            3: `Interviewer: Are there any difficulties in performing kodan? Nanshun: Of course. As an English speaker, there are various challenges. Some Japanese sounds like rya/ryu/ryo were especially difficult. I used to practice kodan loudly in a karaoke box so that I could master these sounds. Also, sometimes it’s hard for me to understand old Japanese. One time, I couldn’t express the nuance of ifu-rin’zen. Even after I learned the meaning in English, it was still very hard to deliver. So, I must learn more about Japan and the Japanese language. Interviewer: That makes sense. What do you think about performing for Japanese audiences? Nanshun: They are wonderful, but sometimes it is challenging to know their feelings. I usually need to make adjustments for each performance according to their mood. If they are relaxed, I can perform freely. However, if they are a little shy, I have to work much harder to bring them into my world.`,
            4: `Interviewer: What’s your next goal as a kodan-shi? Nanshun: Well, I want to continue my work in kodan for a long time. Therefore, I got a permanent resident visa in Japan. Japanese history is fascinating for me, but not for everyone else. So, I will continue to share the wonders of Japanese culture by performing kodan. I hope kodan will become much more popular throughout the country. Interviewer: Do you have a message for Japanese high school students? Nanshun: Yes, I do. Don’t be afraid of having dreams. Whether you succeed or not, your life will be enriched by challenging yourself. Sometimes others may disagree with you because they think your dreams are too difficult to achieve. Ryoma once said, “Even if people say negative things about me, I continue to believe in myself.” I say these words to myself every day.`

            1: `If we need to change people’s behavior, what should we do? One common approach is a sign that tells people what to do. However, as we know from experience, signs seem to work only sometimes. We need to find some new approaches. For example, how can we get people to return file boxes properly on a shelf? Look at Picture 1. If a single line is drawn through the backs of the file boxes, people will know where to put them. How about making children put away their toys? Well, place a basketball hoop above the toy box as you see in Picture 2. Then, children will want to toss their toys into the box. These two examples are indirect ways to change people’s behavior. They encourage people to behave better willingly. Such approaches are called shikake, or triggers.`,
            2: `Let’s look at some other examples. How can we get people to use stairs instead of escalators? An experiment was done at a train station in Sweden. The stairs were designed like piano keys. As people climbed, they made piano-like sounds with their feet. The “Piano Stairs” experiment was very successful. More people used the stairs, and thus got more exercise. There is another trigger called “The World’s Deepest Bin.” A trash bin had a sensor to make a long falling sound when people put trash in it. Many people wanted to hear it again, so they threw away more trash. This special bin collected much more trash than a regular bin. How can we create such effective triggers? Sometimes combining things in unique ways leads to new, flexible ideas. This can motivate us to act in a different, positive manner.`,
            3: `A flexible perspective is necessary when we deal with social problems. For instance, many children in South Africa once died from diseases. It was because they didn’t wash their hands enough. To get children to wash their hands regularly, a toy was put inside each piece of soap. Children became eager to wash their hands because they wanted to get the toy. The soap used in this successful program was called “Hope Soap.” Let’s look at another example. In 1995, more than a million volunteers went to help after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. However, it was difficult to match volunteers’ skills with victims’ needs. Later, dekimasu zekken was created to solve this problem. Volunteers wrote their skills on sheets of paper and put them on their backs. Dekimasu zekken still brings people together and promotes communication in disaster areas.`,
            4: `As we have seen, social problems can be solved with flexible approaches like triggers. This is called “social design,” and we can see it in a number of Japanese local communities. Take as an example, Inakadate Village, a famous rice-growing area in Aomori. For many years, it didn’t have any special tourist spots. In 1993, villagers began to design rice fields as art. These beautiful fields now attract more than a quarter million visitors each year. Here is another good example. Kumamoto Castle has been raising money for renovations in an interesting way. Contributors can register their names as “castle lords.” Nearly 200 million yen was collected for its reconstruction in the six months after the 2016 earthquakes. If we want to change our communities for the better, then we need flexible approaches. Let’s take advantage of social design to improve our own communities.`

            1: `Have you ever heard of Rwanda? It is a country with great natural beauty in central Africa. Marie Louise Kambenga, a peace activist, is from Rwanda. She was the only girl who graduated from high school in her village. She studied home economics, and after graduation, became a dressmaking teacher. In her school, there was a Japanese volunteer. She recommended Louise as a trainee in Japan. In 1993, Louise came to Fukushima as a trainee to study dressmaking. Living with a host family in Japan was a completely new experience for her. Louise was really amazed when she saw an elderly woman reading a newspaper. She had never seen such a thing! Louise was also impressed with Japan’s educational system, especially free public education for all children. In Rwanda, many poor children could not go to school. In 1994, after an interesting 10-month experience, Louise returned to her husband and children in Rwanda.`,
            2: `Two months after her return, her life suddenly changed. One evening, Louise and her family heard a loud explosion. She did not know what was happening in her country until she received a phone call from Japan. Her host family told her that the president of Rwanda had been assassinated. The country fell into confusion. In the early 20th century, Rwandan people were divided and set against each other by Belgian rulers. These groups started to fight one another. After the assassination of the president, the situation got worse and worse. People even killed their relatives just because they were from different groups. The confusion caused a genocide, that is, the mass killing of people. Louise and her family had to escape from Rwanda. On the way to the border, there was death all around them. Shockingly, they saw young people killed right in front of them.`,
            3: `At last, Louise and her family arrived at one of the refugee camps in the Congo. However, the camp was like hell. People could not find enough food, so they had to eat grass to stay alive. A large number of people died every day. One day, when Louise was standing in line to send a fax to Japan, a Japanese volunteer doctor spoke to her. He realized that Louise knew some Japanese because he noticed hiragana on her paper. He asked her if she could work as an interpreter in the camp. Unbelievably, when she escaped from Rwanda, her Japanese dictionary had been in her bag. This unexpected item enabled her to work as an interpreter and save many other refugees. Louise and her family stayed in the camp for six months. After that, thanks to her Japanese friends, she came to Japan again, this time with her family. She finally escaped from this horrible civil war.`,
            4: `Louise believes that the Rwandan civil war was caused by a lack of education. People in Rwanda were easily manipulated during the war. In other words, they could not tell right from wrong. She has realized that education is the key to preventing future wars. When education can create peace in a village, then it can also build a peaceful nation. With this knowledge, Louise established a school for children in Rwanda. All children can attend this school even if they do not have money. Young people’s thinking changed after that. In the past, when children in Rwanda were asked about their dreams, they said, “Can I live until I’m a grown-up?” Now, school children in Rwanda have dreams for the future. Today, Louise lives in Japan. She survived the Rwandan genocide through education. She keeps sharing her experiences with people in both Rwanda and Japan.`

            1: `We use various units such as meters, seconds, and grams to measure things in our daily lives. Have you ever thought about the origins of these units? History gives us some hints about the role of units in our lives. We humans have evolved by learning how to measure the world around us. The earliest recorded system of units dates back to the Old Stone Age, more than 15,000 years ago. People in those days counted and recorded how much of each food they had collected. In addition, about 5,000 years ago, Sumerians of Mesopotamia kept records of their crops and livestock. These examples show us how early humans began to build their communities. By sharing a counting system, people could measure things more clearly. Thus, they could communicate better and trade with each other more fairly.`,
            2: `How did people originally measure the length of things around them? In ancient times, they used parts of the human body. For example, in ancient Egypt and Greece, the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger was called a cubit. In those days, one cubit was around 50 centimeters long. Half a cubit was called a span. This was the distance between one’s outstretched thumb and little finger. In the same way, Japan also based measurements on the body. The units shaku and sun were imported from China into Japan. One shaku was originally the distance between a person’s thumb and middle finger. One sun was measured as the width of the thumb, which is almost equal to one inch in the US.`,
            3: `The units for weight and volume were often based on everyday foods. In the West, grain for making bread was used to define units. Originally,
